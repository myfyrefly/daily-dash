# daily-dash

This is a basic planner that will include color coded time slots for past, present, and future events, and retain input using local storage.

Made with HTML, CSS, and jQuery(Moment.js library), and Andrux Random Famous Quotes API

Future Development:
- clean up code using jQuery to create elements vs hard coding in HTML
- still needs color coding for rows based on time of day
- modify API call to only call once per day versus each reload of the page
